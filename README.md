## Running the project:

1. Clone the git repo
2. Download Expo CLI `npm install expo-cli --global` in terminal/command line
      1. At this point it may make you get an account, but if it doesn't
          you should make one anyway and make sure that you are logged in
3. Download Expo Client on your phone, or get a iOS or android device
      simulator
      1. You should also log into your account on your phone
4. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where the project exists
5. install (`npm install`) the following libraries:
        native-base
        react-native elements
        react-native-responsive-screens

7. Open the phone app, navigate to projects and click the project under
        Recently in Development
        1. Alternatively, you could select either run on iOS simulator or
                run on android simulator, if you have a simulator open on
                your machine
        2. You could also scan the QR code with your phone, assuming you have
